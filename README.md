# InstaGiario-bot
 This is a code that automates writing letter by letter and posting comments for instagram. 
 
# Written in Python, we use the modules:

Selenium-Webdriver:
(pip install selenium)
Pwinput:
(pip install pwinput)
Keyboard:
(pip install keyboard)

I used the webdriver for Google Chrome, available at:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Select your version and download.
This driver needs to be in the python path or InstaGiario-bot path.

# Before Run

*On line 146 enter your list of comments as shown in the code example.*


Save, run the code and the terminal will ask for the publication link, then the total number of comments to be made and then how many comments (from the list) should be made per publication.
