# InstaGlowUp
 This is a code that automates writing letter by letter and posting comments for instagram.
 
# Written in Python, we use the modules:

Tkinter:
(pip install tkinter)

Selenium-Webdriver:
(pip install selenium)

*On line 66 enter your list of comments as shown in the code example.*

*On line 162 enter your username and password as shown in the code (without @)*

Save, run the code and the terminal will ask for the publication link, then the total number of comments to be made and then how many comments (from the list) should be made per publication.
