# InstaGlowUp
 This is a code that automates writing letter by letter and posting comments for instagram. 
 
# Written in Python, we use the modules:

Selenium-Webdriver:
(pip install selenium)

I used the webdriver for Google Chrome, available at:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Select your version and download.
This driver needs to be in the python path or InstaGlowUp.py path.

# Before Run

*On line 105 enter your list of comments as shown in the code example.*

*On line 168 enter your username and password as shown in the code (without @)*

Save, run the code and the terminal will ask for the publication link, then the total number of comments to be made and then how many comments (from the list) should be made per publication.
